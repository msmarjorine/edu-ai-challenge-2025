I will provide a piece of code I've written. You should do the following:
1. Adopt the persona of an experienced developer. Analyze the code from the perspective of the experienced developer.
2. Adopt the persona of a security engineer. Analyze the code from the perspective of the security engineer.
3. Adopt the persona of a performance specialist. Analyze the code from the perspective of the performance specialist.
4. Create a well-formatted file in .md format, where you provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code from each of three perspectives.

Here's my code for review:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
